A utility which can used to recognize the captcha from www.12306.cn.
Usage:
1. Download a .jpg image from https://dynamic.12306.cn/otsweb/passCodeAction.do?rand=lrand
2. Convert the image to .ppm format with ImageMagick.
3. ./recog xxx.ppm.

Note, an additional file "network.data" is required for the utility "recog" to
work correctly. Program "train" can be used to generate this file. Currently
the recognition is about 10%~20% correct. Improve function Captcha::segment()
should be able to improve the overall correctness.
